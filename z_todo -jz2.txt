Add the rest of the calculation logic.



QUESTIONS FOR BRYCE:

What's the default box for POLD-Only systems? Normal shipper? (define around line 612). // FUNCTION:  If LDS is 0 (POLD-Only)

(I guess accessories box is default extra box?)

// 14x14x14 = 48 (Use only if EJB is included or if Point total is greater than or equal to 49) -Bryce
// I'm guessing this is the overflow box and not the primary box -Jake


// Four Hour Timer
// Does this always go in a 4hrtimer box or does it go in standard boxes like Shipper or 14x14?


// I'm assuming the four hour timer box is only used if a single timer or recirc switch is sent, but if both are sent, 
// then they'll be in something else?
if ((valueFourHour == 1 || valueRecirc == 1) && (totalValueTotal == 6)) {


Add LDS power wire?

Add split system stuff?







Add Mailer "if case" for replacement or shipping of single accessory:
Mailer(11x9x1) = 2.5 (Use for shipments of accesory only)


// TODO:  Highlight selected button (LDS) on load

Separate buttons on top row.

Hide more acessories if POLD-Only is selected? (API, Recirc, FourHour, SSR, PAM-1, Junction, Insulated)?

Make the system toggles on top indicate something on the sheet (like make them a header on the report?).

Put accessory inputs on shared line to take up less vertical room.

Add section titles, and collapsible "Uncommon Accessories" sections?

Maybe format as important/common things on left, uncommon/default things on right column.

Hide extraPold section if POLDs goes back to 0.


Need to make a loop for assigning POLDs one at a time to a box, storing the value of which box has the most, 
then at the end, assign SSRs to that box as well (with value of 0 I guess).
"Solid State Relays included with box carrying most POLDs"






---
Icons or images beside each accessory box.

Add logo of shelled peanut halfway out of an open box (flaps 45 degrees up/out, corner facing us). Use as favicon too.

Put version/revision number on page (bottom right).

Wizard design? Where things show up after clicking the previous thing (to filter options by LDS/POLD only/accessories only/replacement/custom/all/etc).

Auto generate & print packing label (packing list sticker on box, not fedex label or actual packing list). (Maybe create a new window at 4x6, or a text file on server side or something).

Bigger up/down number buttons?

Show up/down number buttons by default, before entering anything?

DONE
---------------------------------
Add dark mode.

Add vertical spacing/padding/gutter/gap between div elements.

Change accordians to rows that start hidden until you click a button, so its one seamless block. (Just have many blocks already created, and only show the relevant ones as you press buttons.
