Add the rest of the calculation logic.

Add an extra variable, for boxValueLeft/boxSpaceLeft
Line 582

Subtract item value from each box. (is only subtracting from the total and comparing)


Hidden wire should just be length entry (ft).
(maybe default it to 1 wire, or a checkbox which evaluates to 0 or 1).






if recirc or 4hr is the only overflow item, put in recirc box instead of accessory


// Four Hour Timer
// Does this always go in a 4hrtimer box or does it go in standard boxes like Shipper or 14x14?
--goes in shipper or accessory box with other stuff unless its the only other item


Add LDS power wire?
include (value 0) in shipper. number entry (5ft increments, default 10ft)


Add split system stuff?
checkbox for b1 and b2, no real change. b3 needs a bit more logic.





Add Mailer "if case" for replacement or shipping of single accessory:
Mailer(11x9x1) = 2.5 (Use for shipments of accesory only)


// TODO:  Highlight selected button (LDS) on load

Separate buttons on top row.

Hide more acessories if POLD-Only is selected? (API, Recirc, FourHour, SSR, PAM-1, Junction, Insulated)?

Make the system toggles on top indicate something on the sheet (like make them a header on the report?).

Put accessory inputs on shared line to take up less vertical room.

Add section titles, and collapsible "Uncommon Accessories" sections?

Maybe format as important/common things on left, uncommon/default things on right column.

Hide extraPold section if POLDs goes back to 0.


Split POLDs between boxes.
Need to make a loop for assigning POLDs one at a time to a box, storing the value of which box has the most, 
then at the end, assign SSRs to that box as well (with value of 0 I guess).
"Solid State Relays included with box carrying most POLDs"






---
Icons or images beside each accessory box.

Add logo of shelled peanut halfway out of an open box (flaps 45 degrees up/out, corner facing us). Use as favicon too.

Put version/revision number on page (bottom right).

Wizard design? Where things show up after clicking the previous thing (to filter options by LDS/POLD only/accessories only/replacement/custom/all/etc).

Auto generate & print packing label (packing list sticker on box, not fedex label or actual packing list). (Maybe create a new window at 4x6, or a text file on server side or something).

Bigger up/down number buttons?

Show up/down number buttons by default, before entering anything?











---------------------------------
DONE
---------------------------------
Checkboxes should default to 0 or 1, not on or undefined.


Add Replacement text on top of dialog box.


QUESTIONS FOR BRYCE:

What's the default box for POLD-Only systems? Normal shipper? (define around line 612). 
// FUNCTION:  If LDS is 0 (POLD-Only)
---accessory box

(I guess accessories box is default extra box?)

// 14x14x14 = 48 (Use only if EJB is included or if Point total is greater than or equal to 49) -Bryce
// I'm guessing this is the overflow box and not the primary box -Jake
ya


// I'm assuming the four hour timer box is only used if a single timer or recirc switch is sent, but if both are sent, 
// then they'll be in something else?
if ((valueFourHour == 1 || valueRecirc == 1) && (totalValueTotal == 6)) {
ya put in accessory box


Add dark mode.

Add vertical spacing/padding/gutter/gap between div elements.

Change accordians to rows that start hidden until you click a button, so its one seamless block. (Just have many blocks already created, and only show the relevant ones as you press buttons.
