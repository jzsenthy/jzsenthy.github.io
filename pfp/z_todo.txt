Finish split-system rules (b3 especially).

Single panel should be in padded mailer, not accessory box:
  Accessory Box (13x10x5)  [Box 1 of 1]:
  • 1 Control Panel

[EW] Add lds power wire length option, since it has the potential to spill into another box. //Warehouse has to come up with a rule for it.

Weigh the current junction box

Add Wireless POLD Repeater as a product option?


Maybe make error if you check the box for split system but don't select a split system type. (Currently showing B0).

Maybe make specific error if you check the box for split system but don't select an LDS size. (Currently showing an item leftover error).

Maybe reset split system type to 0 when unchecking split system box or switching tabs to pold only or accessories only (I don't think this is currently causing issues though).

Maybe change 0 space value items like SCV to have a value or a maximum item limit (per box?), to avoid results like saying 10,000 SCV fit in one accessory box

Maybe add a pold to split systems by default (since this happens).

Make cases for the bubble mailer, which shipping just one item like control panel replacement (maybe 1-2 POLD).

Maybe make cases for using the control panel box as well when only a couple items (API, POLD), instead of defaulting to accessory box.

Indent the left edge of split system dropdown like the hidden wire box.

Put accessory inputs on shared line to take up less vertical room.

Add white outline to favicon.

Add instructions to bottom of results page (select Zebra ZP500 printer. Each box will print on it's own page. You can also save as /print to pdf if you want)

Add LDS power wire?
include (value 0) in shipper. number entry (5ft increments, default 10ft)

Add more separation to buttons on top row.

Add section titles, and collapsible "Uncommon Accessories" sections?

Maybe format as important/common things on left, uncommon/default things on right column.

Make scrollTo work again to scroll to top from Reset button.

// TODO:  "Solid State Relays included with box carrying most POLDs"  (although putting it in the last box a pold or leak rope went into is a lot easier)
"Solid State Relays included with box carrying most POLDs"
Need to make a loop for assigning POLDs one at a time to a box, storing the value of which box has the most, (loop/function variables defined at top)
then at the end, assign SSRs to that box as well (with value of 0 I guess).

Add weightCurrentIteam (or related working variable) to debugging output, to see the calculations happening step by step.

Change "approximate box weight:" to "≈"





---
MAYBE DO
---

Fix/add CSS to the Saving... box so the 100vw width doesn't create scrollbars

Improve pdf quality for printing. (higher jpg quality, larger text, or https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake ).

Generate a friendlier error message when selecting a split system without an lds size.

Don't proceed to packing if a split system is selected but no valve size is selected? (Or maybe don't proceed at all without LDS size if you're in the LDS Valve section).

Adding something like btn-outline-info to the div containing the checkboxes is kinda cool to show how large of a clickable area you have.

[BS] PFP doesn't allow for more than one system. Might want to look into that. //no

Keep revision number on bottom of results page, so i can see it in screenshots of issues (may not be useful since issues are being sent through saving the printout as pdf).

Change weightCurrentBox variable name to weightCurrentBoxTotal for clarity between boxWeightSingle/nextBoxWeightSingle

Change packItem.valueApi etc variable name to packItem.formAmountApi or something, to differentiate space values with user entered values.

Replace valueCurrentItem variable name with amountCurrentItem or something.

Maybe save the values from the extra leak rope section first to restore if section is shown again

Have a separate button to Save results (as pdf? csv?) for uploading to zoho? Remove the page breaks from that version, so it prints on like 1 page.

Blank out the form entries for inputs that were hidden when switching system types (like insulated pouches when switching to POLD-Only)

Add date to printed pages? (maybe not, otherwise they'll know if we held it or something)

Maybe default the page size to 4x6? 
But might make it hard to tell if it's going to the right printer (i'm assuming i can't choose a default printer).

Selecting specific printer with javascript
If you have a closed environment (like an intranet) you could print on the server side to a printer connected to a server. The exact details would depend on your server setup and you'd best discuss that with your local system administrator.
https://stackoverflow.com/a/17349503

Maybe add level 1 and level 2 debugging levels, for basic info like these 2 lines, versus a line after each and every item is packed

Align checkboxes that are near the top

Align the edges of all input elements (maybe use/don't use row elements?).

Add Mailer "if case" for replacement or shipping of single accessory:
Mailer(11x9x1) = 2.5 (Use for shipments of accesory only)

Checkboxes aren't working with chrome dark mode extension. (might be an issue with the bootstrap dark version fork i'm using?)

Might wanna change bullets to blank spaces for shippers to add checkmarks when they pack items.

Change page title on sumbit/print to a good filename (maybe even a client name entry box?) like 2021-04-17 ClientName (maybe with a random string of numbers at the end or timestamp, so there aren't duplicate filenames) or 2021-04-17 0223p ClientName  or  2021-04-17 1422 ClientName

Icons or images beside each accessory form entry.

Add logo of shelled peanut halfway out of an open box (flaps 45 degrees up/out, corner facing us). Use as favicon too.

Wizard design? Where things show up after clicking the previous thing (to filter options by LDS/POLD only/accessories only/replacement/custom/all/etc).

Bigger up/down number buttons?

Show up/down number buttons by default, before entering anything?

// Currently just hard defining this group of items as always going in the first box (not checking if they fit) (according to Bryce rules)
// Maybe change this if there are enough cases to break it, like multiple control panels or something.
"Panel, SCV, Hidden Wire and Pam1 always in Box 1"

DONE

3.2.7  2022-11-15 ---
fixed fourHour/recirc box w/juncBox/insulPouch
---
Fixed four hour timer / recirc pump not going into fourhour/recirc box if it's the only overflow item going into a new box (besides insulated pouch or junction box).
(Having an extra insulPouch/juncBox was failing to consider it as the last item)
(Was only considering using this box as the second box, not for subsequent/final box as well)




3.2.6  2022-11-15 ---
fixed largePSU not blanking on pold-only/accessories tab




3.2.5  2022-11-15 ---
added largePSU for 2.5-3" LDS. value 19
---
Added automatic Large PSU with LDS 2.5-3" systems, in separate box (which can include accessories). 

Packing it first after primary box (defaulting to 14x14x14 for any item larger than an Accessory Box--12pt). Thus my random 19pt value does have meaning. If we change this space value, we need to make sure it still defaults into a box it'll fit in.

Weight is also random currently (19lb).




3.2.4  2022-01-27 ---
Updated POLD max value description
---
Updated POLD max value description from 30 to "if more than 30, contact warehouse".




3.2.3  2021-11-19 ---
Solved totalValueCurrent = NaN. Reordered functions chronologically
---
* Reordered functions so they appear in the code according to how they execute chronologically (to make code easier to understand).

* Solved an issue with  totalValueCurrent = NaN 

This was preventing calculations like figuring whether to pack lots of accessories into a 14x14x14 instead of lots of small accessory boxes.

When I was dynamically retrieving a variable name/value based on the value of the Split System dropdown selection, 
for example:  valueSplitSystemSelect == 3, then variable name is  packingItem.splitSystemB3
the issue was that if nothing was selected in the dropdown, the variable name I was resolving was  packingItem.splitSystemB0  
and that didn't exist (my default variable name was packingItem.splitSystem).
After attempting other methods of resolving the variable name, I realized the actual issue and then added  packingItem.splitSystemB0  as a default variable.

Relevant code:

var packingItem = {
    splitSystem: 0,
    splitSystemB0: 0, // Doesn't exist, just a default placeholder. Needed for dynamic variable retrieval
    splitSystemB1: 0,
    splitSystemB2: 0,
    splitSystemB3: 30,
};

var valueSplitSystemSelect = Number(document.getElementById("selectSplitSystem").value);

var totalValueSplitSystemCheck = valueSplitSystemCheck * Function('return packingItem.splitSystemB' + valueSplitSystemSelect)();

var totalValueTotal = totalValueSplitSystemCheck + totalValueLds + totalValueScv + totalValueCp +
    totalValuePoldPin + totalValuePoldLeakRope2ft + totalValuePoldLeakRope5ft + totalValuePoldLeakRope10ft +
    totalValueLeakRope2ft + totalValueLeakRope5ft + totalValueLeakRope10ft + totalValueApi +
    totalValueRecirc + totalValueFourHour + totalValueSsr + totalValuePam1 + totalValueJuncBox +
    totalValueInsulPouch + totalValueHiddenWire;

var totalValueCurrent = totalValueTotal;




3.2.2  2021-11-18 ---
Add Split System B3 logic, Bootstrap saved locally
---
Make Split System B3 = 30 (Defaults to a Large Accessory Box (14x14x14) = 48, 18 points free. Inform user to double-check with warehouse on specifics, since 30 is an average value)

Downloaded bootstrap dark/night css file and bootstrap+popper script for backup and potentially running locally.
Added a line for each in the code for local loading (instead of CDN) but commented them both out for now.




3.2.1  2021-11-17 ---
Changed EJB to separate 14x14x8 box, fixed some empty box 1 bugs
---
Updated these two rules from Bryce's box logic changes:
  Electrical Junction Box = (Defaults to a full 14x14x8 box. changed from 36 points in a Medium Shipper)
  Insulated Pouch = (Defaults to a full Medium Shipper. changed from 6 points) (seems to already be working this way)

Fixed bug where an empty box 1 was showing (only when packing insulated pouches with no LDS).
Insulated pouch has a special case with code copied from the putInBox function, but it was missing a line to check if previous box was empty.

Fixed bug with box 1 title not showing with no LDS but with junction box etc.
Had to comment out special junction box code section, now that we aren't packing it that way.

VSCodeBeautify added tons of unnecessary line breaks between my code (and deleted some of my intentional whitespace).




3.2.0  2021-07-20 ---
Updated version number for public release.

Main change was addition of save to pdf button (for more than 1 page).




3.1.10  2021-07-19 ---
Added datetime to the pdf export filename (using custom constructed format with Luxon javascript library).
(ISO 8601 format customized with underscores, 2 digits per component with leading 0s.)
(Moved html2pdf options into the function called from the save button, so the datetime value actually updates instead of being written on page load.)




3.1.9  2021-07-19 ---
Fixed the issue with split-system still being checked when switching to POLD-Only tab, thus 1 leftover item after packing. (Now putting checked state to false, setting value to 0, and clearing dropdown value when changing tabs or selecting no LDS)




3.1.8  2021-07-16 ---
Increased pdf print quality a bit by doubling scale to 4 (text was scratchy).  // html2canvas: { scale: 4 }

Note: html2pdf fails (generates blank pages) if working with over ~60 pages. (Might have to do with page height, and the top of the page being unloaded from the browser when you scroll to bottom).




3.1.7  2021-07-15 ---
Remove extra padding after saving (set it back to 20px).

Set pdf image type to 'jpeg' instead of 'jpg' to fix large filesize issue.




3.1.6  2021-07-15 ---
[EW] "Save to pdf" option (for remote workers to save the packing list and send to local worker to print).

Added html2pdf library to export the #resultsBox div as a jpg (with page breaks) in pdf form (png was too large filesize, and png compression library didn't work). (Supposedly jsPDF library doesn't support css).

Add/remove a css class (.printCss) to parent div (body) to add/remove the css styles for printing when saving to pdf (easier than loading an external stylesheet through javascript then trying to get rid of it). (Just duplicated the @media print  css rules).

Add a "Saving..." div with dark background, filling the window, to show while saving pdf (so you dont see white flash when css changes).

Scroll to top while saving the pdf (to hide the white background on bottom div).

Add extra padding to the top of each page to offset the incorrect positioning that html2pdf applies.
(Add X pixels (X is page number) to the padding-top CSS style per page to correct html2pdf incorrect alignment offset.)




3.1.5  2021-06-28 ---
Moved reset button and Submit to the left side (along with Replacement checkbox.) Version number moved to right.

Added arrow symbols to the "Go Back" and "Start Over" results buttons, to make it clearer what they do.




3.1.4  2021-06-28 ---
Moved reset button next to Submit on the right side since it felt natural to press the button on the left since all other inputs were on the left.




3.1.3  2021-06-08 ---
Added warnings about B3 rules not being done (in the dropdown, once selecting B3, and on Submit)

Updated version number.




3.1.2  2021-05-14 ---
Don't show box weight when nothing was packed. Show "Nothing to pack?".




3.1.1  2021-05-14 ---
Round weights to nearest pound.

Dim the weight text (text-muted) so it doesn't make the results look cluttered. 

Rewording POLD help text to "If requesting more than 15, email a list of zones."

Hide the debugging checkbox on bottom so it only shows when version number is clicked.




3.1.0  2021-05-14 ---
First public release (just upped version number).




3.0.16  2021-05-07 ---
Fixed splitSystemCheck not getting subtracted from itemsTotalLeft.

Fixed single overflow item fourHour timer not getting packed into fourHour timer box.

Auto-calculate POLD Totals when leak rope section is expanded.

Reset leak rope related form input values to empty when hiding that section.

Added more logic for choosing the first box when there's no LDS (accessories only or pold only).
  Fixed not choosing a large accessory box as the first box if  totalValueTotal > 36.
  Fixed not choosing the four hour timer box if that or recirc is the only item to be packed.




3.0.15  2021-05-06 ---
Added itemsTotalLeft (total number of items left to pack) to replace totalValueCurrent (total space of items) in some places, since some items are worth 0 so it was acting like it was done packing with SSR left.

Added missing valuePam1 into valueTotal and totalValueTotal.

Removed if case paramaters for when to calculate putting items into a large accessory box (now does it after every box is finished).

Added an else case after a box is finished, to reset back to accessory box (was staying on large accessory box if that was previous).

Moved a lot of nextBox code from each item into the putInBox function after finishing a box, so the logic is a lot better for picking the next box now.
(Left nextBox code in the insulPouch section since it needs to force itself into a separate medium shipper every time)

TODO: Fix something not getting subtracted from itemsTotalLeft

---
After packing a 14x14, do another if statement to see if we should stay on 14x14 or switch back to an accessory box (was packing 2 fourHour timers in a 2nd 14x14).

Fix/stop showing weight after leak rope / before ssr. Problem was it shows weight if total value of current items to pack left is 0, and ssr are worth 0. 
Changing to compare total number of items left instead of total calculated item space left to pack.
---




3.0.14  2021-05-06 ---
Fixed insulated pouch boxes weighing too much (else statement was adding box weight twice. should only add at the end of the box).

Compare calculated weights with measured finished/packed box weights with packing list on work pc (all within 0.05-0.46 lbs).

---
insulatedpouch box weight is still messed up.
ref:  2021-05-05 16_56_58-PFP3

Medium Shipper (20x12x8)  [Box 7 of 10]:
• 1 Insulated Pouch
  (approximate box weight: 4.92lbs)

Medium Shipper (20x12x8)  [Box 8 of 10]:
• 1 Insulated Pouch
  (approximate box weight: 6.84lbs)   <---

Medium Shipper (20x12x8)  [Box 9 of 10]:
• 1 Insulated Pouch
  (approximate box weight: 6.84lbs)   <---
---




3.0.13  2021-05-05 ---
Added weights for boxes/packaging materials. (Added variable nextBoxWeightSingle & buildOutputString argument boxWeightSingle)

Adding box/packaging weights just before displaying the  <div class='weightCurrentBox'>.

Copied weight display to  // Pack  Recirc Pump Switch  &  // Pack  Four Hour Timer  cases (in copied putInBox else statement, also in  // Pack  Insulated Pouch)

TODO: Fix first insulated pouch box having incorrect weight? Or later insulated pouch boxes having incorrect weight...

TODO: Compare weighed packed boxes and packing lists with weight auto-calculations.




3.0.12  2021-05-03 ---
Added weight calculation.

No longer showing empty accessory box if there are no LDS or accessories to go in first box.

TODO: Still need to add box/packaging weights, and verify results.

---
Add weights (reference jesse's list?).

Fix weights calculating wrong (too high on single accessory/14x14). Probably multiplying or not resetting or something. (add weight additions for each device, and box weights)

Find a way to show the weight at the end, without having to start packing another box

Hide weights during print

change all these
weightCurrentBox += valuePam1 * packingItemWeight.pam1;
to this
weightCurrentBox += packingItemWeight.pam1;
since we're packing one at a time
(actually leave them as is in the top section that all goes in the first box by default, since those aren't packed one at a time)

changed:
line 644  added 5
added    </div> at 616
removed variables at 1159

2 insul pouches have an empty accessory box first.

// Don't show the accessory box for POLD-Only if it's empty and your first box is something else (like medium shipper for 1 Insulated Pouch or something).
// Results are showing an empty accessory box if all you have is insulated pouches.
// Make sure the "if (lastboxnumberofitems > 0) {}" condition is there.
// Example:
Packing Results:
-- POLD System --
Accessory (13x10x5)  [Box 1 of 62]:
Medium Shipper (20x12x8)  [Box 2 of 62]:
• 1 Insulated Pouch
---	




3.0.11  2021-04-12 ---
Added special cases within packing function, after it finishes packing a box, to check if it just packed an LDS box, then tries to pack a 14x14 first (to avoid cases where a 14x14 is called because a junction box is present but only a few accessories get packed in it first then it picks another 14x14 for junction box, resulting in bigger boxes than needed). 
(I think it's also running after packing an accessory box since it has the same value as the standard lds box (12), but I think it's working better that way in the few cases I've tested so I'm leaving it lol...)

Reordered some form items (API before POLD, to reflect packing order and improve layout. SO# at end since it's not required unless printing labels for multiple boxes, which is probably rare).

Fixed some form spacing, added "Extra Info" section title, added some code comments.




3.0.10  2021-04-08 ---
Changed box names to a standardized format to sync up terms with upstairs/fedex and downstairs/warehouse, to:

Standard Shipper (19x12x7) = 12 (For .75-1.5" systems only)
Medium Shipper (20x12x8) = 6 (Used for 2" systems or Insulated Pouch only)
Large Shipper (18x18x14) = 18 (Used only for 2.5" and 3" systems)
Bubble Mailer (11x9x1) = 2.5 (Use for shipments of accessory only)
Panel Box (10x7x3) = 6
Recirc/4 hr Box (9x4x3) = 6 (Only to be used for single Recirc Pump Switch or 4hr Timer)
Accessory Box (13x10x5) = 12
Large Accessory Box (14x14x14) = 48 (Use only if EJB is included or if Point total is greater than or equal to 49)




3.0.9  2021-04-07 ---
Added favicon from fontawesome and converted by realfavicongenerator.net

Minor wording update to pold error alert.




3.0.8  2021-04-07 ---
Disable print button if there's only one box.

Change "Shipping Order Number" to "Sales Order Number".

Validate if SO# exists when printing multiple boxes.

Hide Known Issues link by default unless debugging is enabled (also open in new tab).




3.0.7  2021-03-31 ---
SO# align right (text-end) on print output.

Hide SO# on additional pages from user display, until you print it.

Remove a line break from print headers like SO#, Replacement, POLD System, Accessories Only.

Reduced width of resultsBoxContainer so SO# isn't so far right.

Changed width of back/start over/print button containers from for better responsive layout.

Changed print button from float-right to float-end.




3.0.6  2021-03-31 ---
Added SO# entry box on top (to keep track of multiple pages together, and matching printed labels to packing lists etc).

Added SO# to each page of print output (not required and not showing if blank).

Defaulting everything to hidden on page load, until system type is selected. (so people won't ignore those buttons, which are used for logic).
(Added 2 new divs to wrap the whole form--besides header buttons--and footer to be hidden by default)

System: LDS  no longer auto-selected by default on page load.

Added short instruction text visible on page load.

Changed which form entries are visible with different system selections, from Bryce’s feedback.
(Hide more acessories if POLD-Only is selected? (Junction Box, Insulated Pouch and 4hr timer should be hidden, I’m thinking Recirc Pump Switch too. -Bryce))

Minor other tweaks like margins and comments.




3.0.5  2021-03-30---
Fixed/Improved print output (color/margin/padding).

Changed negative margin to 0 margin, because it works in every browser. 
(TEST PRINTING IN IE/EDGE. That might be the real exception needed, not firefox. Use negative margin if Edge, otherwise 0 print page margin to hide default added header/footer on print.
Firefox printing centered, with a narrow word wrap area. Might have to reset page size setting or something. Or maybe i have to define my div larger.) 

Changed div margin to padding to fix black padding issue on print.

Added more CSS target divs to force dark mode to light mode for print.




3.0.4 ---

Hide the print headers and footers by default (with date and page info, like that chrome adds)
(Hide the header/footer added by the browser to print output.)
@media print {
@page {margin:0 -6cm}
html {margin:0 6cm}
}

Show the correct headers based on if POLD Only or Accessories Only are selected.
(Don't show "POLD System" if accessories top button is active.)

Hide last 2 lines of debugging into by default

Fix rare bug preventing more than 6 boxes of one item type (now >= 60).

Scroll to top on results page (if box list is long).

Add box number/count on each box title header, like Box 3 of 3 (could maybe use a variable at the end, or replace all instances of a specific string with box total, since box titles/numbers are being built/output to the string before we know the total number of boxes)

Change \n to <br /> & remove <pre> tag on results.
Possible ref i didn't use:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19438895/add-a-new-line-in-innerhtml

Add page breaks on results.
(Format print output to put each box in a 4x6 square or add page breaks if that's possible, to print on separate pages.)




3.0.3 ---

Added version number on bottom.

Back button from print screen in case they don't want to start over

POLD "pins" instead of "probes. -david

SSR in increments of 2. -david

When you click the POLD-Only header, only set cp to 0 if its more than 0. (so otherwise it will be blank)

Form validation for calculating the right number of polds when adding leak rope etc.

Made leak rope as an option to be attached to the pold by default, so they're packed together.

Modified a couple point values from bryce request:
Control Panel = 0  (changed from 1)
Hidden Wire = 3  (changed from 4.5)




3.0.2 ---

Changed reset button to an actual page refresh command, along with a scroll to top command.

(Reset button not fully working (doesn't activate LDS tab or hide the hidden wire length entry).
After resetting, you have to click checkboxes a couple times to get them working again.
Change the reset button to a submit button, to actually refresh the page?)

<!-- Maybe have a "leak rope? Y/N popup before the options show up. or a Probes/LeakRope selector, defaulting to probes.) -->

Hide extraPold section if POLDs goes back to 0.

Add a button to show debugging information (to show hidden divs with printed debugging text under each line printed from the packing function loop). 
Would require breaking the results text into separate strings and putting into separate divs though...
Maybe I could make a toggle before submitting, that runs or doesn't run the debugging lines (and keep them all in the same string).

Add split system stuff?
checkbox for b1 and b2, no real change. b3 needs a bit more logic.

Style the hidden wire length entry differently (card style?) and include ft as a designator/description.

Hidden wire should just be length entry (ft).
(maybe default it to 1 wire, or a checkbox which evaluates to 0 or 1).

Align checkbox right (keeping text and div section on left)
<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="checkHiddenWire">

Include hidden wire length in results text.




3.0.1 ---

Add the rest of the calculation logic.

if recirc or 4hr is the only overflow item, put in recirc box instead of accessory

QUESTION:  What do we do if we're sending multiple insulated pouches? multiple medium shippers, or a bigger box?
ANSWER:  Insulated Pouch will always only fit into the medium shipper. -Bryce
// Insulated Pouch
if (valueInsulPouch > 0) {

QUESTION:  If we have other accessories, should we fit an insulated pouch in an accessory box, or keep it in its own medium shipper?
ANSWER:  Insulated Pouch will always only fit into the medium shipper. -Bryce

Make the system toggles on top indicate something on the sheet (like make them a header on the report?).

// Four Hour Timer
// Does this always go in a 4hrtimer box or does it go in standard boxes like Shipper or 14x14?
--goes in shipper or accessory box with other stuff unless its the only other item

Auto generate & print packing label (packing list sticker on box, not fedex label or actual packing list). (Maybe create a new window at 4x6, or a text file on server side or something).

Highlight selected button (LDS) on load

Function/loop to replace if/else statements for loading group of items into box:
loadItemIntoBox(valueItem,spaceItem,totalValueItem,totalValueCurrent,boxValueLeft,boxValue,currentBox,nextBox,currentBoxValue,nextBoxValue)

Change alert box to something else.
(Javascript alert box truncated after 24 lines (or some amount of characters)).

Add a Reset/Continue/Clear/Start Over button to the results (as well as a Print button, defaulting to 4x6 and zebra printer)

declare all variables outside functions and
delete all extraneous "var" declarations. (dont redeclare/modify variables as  var variable = variable2;)
 (this worked, solved the issue)


// API v2
///////////////////////////////////////
// CURRENTLY WORKING ON   (variables are showing up as undefined, probably because they aren't global. actually because i kept redeclaring them as  var variable, so it created duplicates)
///////////////////////////////////////


When something won't fit in a box, it's currently putting it in the next box whether it fits or not.
Change it to:

function fitInBox {
var loopCount = 0;
while (loopCount < 6) {
 if (it fits) {
  put in box;
  subtract value from box;
  break;
 }
 else {
  change box
  loopCount++;
  if (loopCount == 6) {
  window.alert("I can't fit " + itemName + " in any box, after trying " + loopCount + " times.")
  break;
  }
 }
}


Change  totalValuePold   to 1 item at a time, until  totalValuePold  hits 0

Only include SCV if LDS is > 0

Add an extra variable, for boxValueLeft/boxSpaceLeft
Line 582

Subtract item value from each box. (is only subtracting from the total and comparing)

Fix checkbox not being able to be checked.

Highlight left/selected button by default (default to True)

Checkboxes should default to 0 or 1, not on or undefined.

Add Replacement text on top of dialog box.


QUESTIONS FOR BRYCE:

What's the default box for POLD-Only systems? Normal shipper? (define around line 612). 
// FUNCTION:  If LDS is 0 (POLD-Only)
---accessory box

(I guess accessories box is default extra box?)

// 14x14x14 = 48 (Use only if EJB is included or if Point total is greater than or equal to 49) -Bryce
// I'm guessing this is the overflow box and not the primary box -Jake
ya

// I'm assuming the four hour timer box is only used if a single timer or recirc switch is sent, but if both are sent, 
// then they'll be in something else?
if ((valueFourHour == 1 || valueRecirc == 1) && (totalValueTotal == 6)) {
ya put in accessory box


Add dark mode.

Add vertical spacing/padding/gutter/gap between div elements.

Change accordians to rows that start hidden until you click a button, so its one seamless block. (Just have many blocks already created, and only show the relevant ones as you press buttons.

Change rules to prevent 2 14x14s when packing EJB with second mostly empty.
Only use a 14x14 if it’s packing 36 or more points of accessories, minus the junction box (and insulated pouch) values, (plus specifically pack EJB in a 14x14) then that may solve the issue of using a 14x14 for only a few accessories.
Move the logic from outside of the itempacking function into an if statement before it packs an item, so it leaves the default as an accessory box, then only changes the nextBox to a 14x14 before packing more than 36pt items minus the juncBox and pouch (and/or if it's packing a juncBox), then switch it back to accessory box.
Actually this will call for an accessory box for 2 items, then a 14x14 for a juncbox, when they could've fit in the same box.

// This should pack juncBox plus up to 12pt of accessories in a 14x14
after standard shipper is filled,
if (number of accessories minus ejb and pouch is less than 14x14 space (48) - ejb space (36) (i.e. if currentTotal - totalJuncBoxValue <= 12) nextBox = 14x14
// what happens if we have multiple juncBox though...
// we could have a negative result for the left side of the if statement.


// how about just seeing if we have 1 or more juncBox present first:
if (valueJuncBox >= 1) {
	// then subtracing the value of one juncBox from the currentTotal, and see if it's less than the space remaining in a 14x14 after packing a juncBox:
	if ((currentTotal - packingItem.juncBox) <= (packingItem.box14x14 - packingItem.juncBox) {
		nextBox = 14x14;
	}
}
else if ((currentTotal - packingItem.juncBox) <= (packingItem.box14x14 - packingItem.juncBox) {
	nextBox = 14x14;
}




//////////////// THIS

// Change rules to prevent 2 14x14s when packing EJB with second mostly empty.
// (actually we won't have a negative value because the juncBoxes are all added to the total, so using totalJuncBoxValue should work)

// Run once standard shipper is filled,

	// and see if it's less than the space remaining in a 14x14 after packing a juncBox:
	// TODO:  Make sure the subtraction on the left is working as expected
	// This should allow packing up to 12pt of accessories in a 14x14 plus a juncBox

	// TODO:  Make sure the subtraction on the left is working as expected
	else if ((currentTotal - totalJuncBoxValue - totalInsulPouchValue) >= (packingItem.boxAccessories * 3) {
		nextBox = packingItem.box14x14;
	}
	else {
		nextBox = packingItem.boxAccessories;
		// or no change. return or do nothing, whatever
	}
}
// Duplicated from above, since it applies whether or not there's no juncBox
// TODO:  Make sure the subtraction on the left is working as expected
// or if the total accessories (minus juncBox and insulPouch) are greater than or equal to 3 accessory boxes, then pack in a 14x14 instead
else if ((currentTotal - totalJuncBoxValue - totalInsulPouchValue) >= (packingItem.boxAccessories * 3) {
	nextBox = packingItem.box14x14;
}

	nextBox = packingItem.boxAccessories;
	// or no change. return or do nothing, whatever
}

(Maybe make it work like the pouch.)
(Also only use 14x14x14 first if totalValueTotal >= 49 (or 36) minus the juncBox.)
(If accessories don't equal or exceed 36 points minus juncBox & insulPouch, Keep accessory box as primary nextBox, and just force the juncBox in a 14x14? )
(no that won't work because it's already doing that kinda and gonna waste space if you could fit 12 points of accessories in the 14x14 with it).)
