Make scrollTo work again to scroll to top from Reset button.

Add SO# entry box on top, to keep track of orders printed.

Format print output to put each box in a 4x6 square or add page breaks if that's possible, to print on separate pages.

Put accessory inputs on shared line to take up less vertical room.

"Solid State Relays included with box carrying most POLDs"
Need to make a loop for assigning POLDs one at a time to a box, storing the value of which box has the most, (loop/function variables defined at top)
then at the end, assign SSRs to that box as well (with value of 0 I guess).

Add LDS power wire?
include (value 0) in shipper. number entry (5ft increments, default 10ft)

Add more separation to buttons on top row.

Hide more acessories if POLD-Only is selected? (API, Recirc, FourHour, SSR, PAM-1, Junction, Insulated)?

Add section titles, and collapsible "Uncommon Accessories" sections?

Maybe format as important/common things on left, uncommon/default things on right column.

Maybe change the <pre> text output to normal text and convert \n to <br>

// TODO:  "Solid State Relays included with box carrying most POLDs"  (although putting it in the last box a pold or leak rope went into is a lot easier)






---
MAYBE DO
---

Align checkboxes that are near the top

Number the boxes like Box 1, Box 2.

Align the edges of all input elements (maybe use/don't use row elements?).

Add Mailer "if case" for replacement or shipping of single accessory:
Mailer(11x9x1) = 2.5 (Use for shipments of accesory only)

Checkboxes aren't working with chrome dark mode extension. (might be an issue with the bootstrap dark version fork i'm using?)

Maybe have a "back" button to go back from the results to the form without resetting it, instead of clearing out the entries, for easier testing.

Might wanna print each box results on a different page, to put sticker on each box.

Might wanna change bullets to blank spaces for checkmarks.

Change page title on sumbit/print to a good filename (maybe even a client name entry box?) like 2021-04-17 ClientName (maybe with a random string of numbers at the end or timestamp, so there aren't duplicate filenames) or 2021-04-17 0223p ClientName  or  2021-04-17 1422 ClientName

Icons or images beside each accessory box.

Add logo of shelled peanut halfway out of an open box (flaps 45 degrees up/out, corner facing us). Use as favicon too.

Put version/revision number on page (bottom right).

Wizard design? Where things show up after clicking the previous thing (to filter options by LDS/POLD only/accessories only/replacement/custom/all/etc).

Bigger up/down number buttons?

Show up/down number buttons by default, before entering anything?

// Currently just hard defining this group of items as always going in the first box (not checking if they fit) (according to Bryce rules)
// Maybe change this if there are enough cases to break it, like multiple control panels or something.
"Panel, SCV, Hidden Wire and Pam1 always in Box 1"

























---------------------------------
DONE
---------------------------------






Added version number on bottom.

Back button from print screen in case they don't want to start over

POLD "pins" instead of "probes. -david

SSR in increments of 2. -david

When you click the POLD-Only header, only set cp to 0 if its more than 0. (so otherwise it will be blank)

Form validation for calculating the right number of polds when adding leak rope etc.

Made leak rope as an option to be attached to the pold by default, so they're packed together.

Modified a couple point values from bryce request:
Control Panel = 0  (changed from 1)
Hidden Wire = 3  (changed from 4.5)


Reset button not fully working (doesn't activate LDS tab or hide the hidden wire length entry).

After resetting, you have to click checkboxes a couple times to get them working again.

Change the reset button to a submit button, to actually refresh the page?


<!-- Maybe have a "leak rope? Y/N popup before the options show up. or a Probes/LeakRope selector, defaulting to probes.) -->

Hide extraPold section if POLDs goes back to 0.

Add a button to show debugging information (to show hidden divs with printed debugging text under each line printed from the packing function loop). 
Would require breaking the results text into separate strings and putting into separate divs though...
Maybe I could make a toggle before submitting, that runs or doesn't run the debugging lines (and keep them all in the same string).

Add split system stuff?
checkbox for b1 and b2, no real change. b3 needs a bit more logic.

Style the hidden wire length entry differently (card style?) and include ft as a designator/description.

Hidden wire should just be length entry (ft).
(maybe default it to 1 wire, or a checkbox which evaluates to 0 or 1).

Align checkbox right (keeping text and div section on left)
<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="checkHiddenWire">

Include hidden wire length in results text.

Add the rest of the calculation logic.

if recirc or 4hr is the only overflow item, put in recirc box instead of accessory

QUESTION:  What do we do if we're sending multiple insulated pouches? multiple medium shippers, or a bigger box?
ANSWER:  Insulated Pouch will always only fit into the medium shipper. -Bryce
// Insulated Pouch
if (valueInsulPouch > 0) {

QUESTION:  If we have other accessories, should we fit an insulated pouch in an accessory box, or keep it in its own medium shipper?
ANSWER:  Insulated Pouch will always only fit into the medium shipper. -Bryce

Make the system toggles on top indicate something on the sheet (like make them a header on the report?).

// Four Hour Timer
// Does this always go in a 4hrtimer box or does it go in standard boxes like Shipper or 14x14?
--goes in shipper or accessory box with other stuff unless its the only other item

Auto generate & print packing label (packing list sticker on box, not fedex label or actual packing list). (Maybe create a new window at 4x6, or a text file on server side or something).

Highlight selected button (LDS) on load

Function/loop to replace if/else statements for loading group of items into box:
loadItemIntoBox(valueItem,spaceItem,totalValueItem,totalValueCurrent,boxValueLeft,boxValue,currentBox,nextBox,currentBoxValue,nextBoxValue)

Change alert box to something else.
(Javascript alert box truncated after 24 lines (or some amount of characters)).

Add a Reset/Continue/Clear/Start Over button to the results (as well as a Print button, defaulting to 4x6 and zebra printer)

declare all variables outside functions and
delete all extraneous "var" declarations. (dont redeclare/modify variables as  var variable = variable2;)
 (this worked, solved the issue)


// API v2
///////////////////////////////////////
// CURRENTLY WORKING ON   (variables are showing up as undefined, probably because they aren't global. actually because i kept redeclaring them as  var variable, so it created duplicates)
///////////////////////////////////////


When something won't fit in a box, it's currently putting it in the next box whether it fits or not.
Change it to:

function fitInBox {
var loopCount = 0;
while (loopCount < 6) {
 if (it fits) {
  put in box;
  subtract value from box;
  break;
 }
 else {
  change box
  loopCount++;
  if (loopCount == 6) {
  window.alert("I can't fit " + itemName + " in any box, after trying " + loopCount + " times.")
  break;
  }
 }
}


Change  totalValuePold   to 1 item at a time, until  totalValuePold  hits 0

Only include SCV if LDS is > 0

Add an extra variable, for boxValueLeft/boxSpaceLeft
Line 582

Subtract item value from each box. (is only subtracting from the total and comparing)

Fix checkbox not being able to be checked.

Highlight left/selected button by default (default to True)

Checkboxes should default to 0 or 1, not on or undefined.

Add Replacement text on top of dialog box.


QUESTIONS FOR BRYCE:

What's the default box for POLD-Only systems? Normal shipper? (define around line 612). 
// FUNCTION:  If LDS is 0 (POLD-Only)
---accessory box

(I guess accessories box is default extra box?)

// 14x14x14 = 48 (Use only if EJB is included or if Point total is greater than or equal to 49) -Bryce
// I'm guessing this is the overflow box and not the primary box -Jake
ya

// I'm assuming the four hour timer box is only used if a single timer or recirc switch is sent, but if both are sent, 
// then they'll be in something else?
if ((valueFourHour == 1 || valueRecirc == 1) && (totalValueTotal == 6)) {
ya put in accessory box


Add dark mode.

Add vertical spacing/padding/gutter/gap between div elements.

Change accordians to rows that start hidden until you click a button, so its one seamless block. (Just have many blocks already created, and only show the relevant ones as you press buttons.
